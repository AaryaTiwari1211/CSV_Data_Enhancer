26,4,National College of Art and Design ,national-college-of-art-and-design," National College of Art and Design can be traced back to Robert West's drawing school in George's Lane, founded in 1746 and funded by the Dublin Society. The French Enlightenment, Victorian schools of design, particularly industrial design, the Arts and Crafts movement, the search for Irish national identity, and developments in British art education in the 1960s have all impacted this institution.  The school also influenced Irish social and cultural developments, significantly influencing the eighteenth-century Irish school of painting and sculpture and the standard of applied adornment in architecture and crafts. Most notable 20th Century Irish artists have studied at the college, including Sir William Orpen and Oliver Sheppard. There was an impetus for industrial design reform in the face of an independent Ireland's new economic future. As a result of this movement, a statute was passed in 1971 that re-established the institution and gave it academic autonomy. In 1975, the college was reformed again, and a wide range of degree programs was created.  After moving to Thomas Street in the early 1980s, the institution expanded its undergraduate program and added a variety of postgraduate courses and research-based alternatives up to the doctoral level. ","Academic Requirements: Bachelors: Students from outside Ireland who wish to pursue a bachelor's degree at NCAD must obtain a high school diploma from their native country equivalent to the Irish School Leaving Certificate.International applicants must provide certified copies of their second-level or equivalent examination transcripts.You must submit both the original language version and a verified English translation of your transcripts. Masters: International applicants must present certified transcripts of all past educational achievements, including second-level or comparative tests and bachelor's degree score cards.You must submit both the original language version and a verified English translation of your transcripts.  English Requirements: ","<table><tbody><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Exam</strong></p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Score</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">IELTS</p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">An average score of 6.5 over all components and a minimum of 6.0 in each band on the Academic Version.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">TOEFL</p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;""><span style=""background-color:transparent;color:#666666;"">A minimum score of 90 is required with no less than 21 in writing and at least 19 in every other section.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">PTE</p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">Minimum of 63 and at least 59 for each item in the Communicative Skills section.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">Duolingo</p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">The minimum requirement will be a DET score of 110 is required with at least 100 in each subscore.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">Oxford Test of English</p></td><td><p style=""text-align:center;"">A minimum score of 130 overall with a minimum score of 125 in each skill.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","The NCAD Careers Service seeks to provide students with the knowledge, resources, and confidence to manage their creative careers independently.

Because of the community built and fostered by the students on their floor, pod, or building, students who live on campus are frequently better connected to the University. Living in a residential setting teaches pupils essential life skills. Returning students live in suite-style facilities and townhouses, while first-year students dwell in traditional halls. The housing options provided by the university are as follows: Residence Halls Traditional residence halls, one all-women residence hall, and four coeducational residence halls provide a variety of living arrangements to accommodate students' requirements and interests. All are furnished and have access to Wi-Fi internet. A central living area with a community TV/lounge, laundry rooms, and kitchenettes is also provided at each facility. Centennial Hall Centennial Hall is a coed residential hall with single and double rooms built around shared lounge areas known as ""pods."" Gender-specific pods, as well as gender-neutral pods, are available in Centennial Hall. Centennial Hall is a residence hall for new Northwest University and international students in their first year on campus. For more information, visit: https://www.nebrwesleyan.edu/inside-nwu/living-campus/living-campus/centennial-hall  Johnson Hall Johnson Hall, Nebraska Wesleyan University's most historic residence hall, is an all-female residence hall with its charm and distinctiveness. The addition of air conditioning, remodelling interior spaces, constructing an elevator, replacing windows and the roof, expanding restrooms, increasing energy efficiency, refurbishing rooms and common spaces, and improving accessibility were all part of Johnson Hall's extensive renovation in the summer of 2012. For more information, visit: https://www.nebrwesleyan.edu/inside-nwu/living-campus/living-campus/johnson-hall  Pioneer Hall Pioneer Hall, NWU's most recently rebuilt residence hall, allows students to build tight, supportive communities. Pioneer Hall and Johnson Hall are connected by a big basement lounge with a small kitchen, ping pong table, study tables, pool table, and a television. It is also the most convenient residence hall in terms of proximity to the Story Student Center and dining hall. By half floors, Pioneer Hall, which houses first-year residents, is normally co-educational. For more information, visit: https://www.nebrwesleyan.edu/inside-nwu/housing/living-campus/pioneer-hall  Plainsman Hall Plainsman Hall is a coeducational, air-conditioned facility near the Elder Memorial Speech and Theatre Center as well as the Weary Center for Health and Fitness.

These suites, which typically house four students, feature a central living area with a kitchenette that includes a small refrigerator and microwave, as well as two bedrooms and bathrooms. A lounge featuring a TV, pool table, foosball, computers, and study tables are located on each floor. A modest kitchen and a patio on the first level allow space for outside lounging. Townhouses The Townhouse Village provides self-contained living in 30 air-conditioned four-person flats. There are four individual bedrooms and two bathrooms in each unit. A 21-cubic-foot refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher, and full-size, stackable washing and dryer are included in the townhouse. Student Apartments Air-conditioned student apartments provide living facilities for juniors and seniors alone. In most cases, each flat accommodates two students. Some apartments are efficiency units, while others have one or two bedrooms. The flats remain open for their inhabitants during the Fall, Winter, and Spring breaks without charging an additional break housing cost. Greek Living After two complete semesters in a residential hall, students who are active members in good standing can reside in a sorority or fraternity chapter house with the authorisation of the dean of students in consultation with each chapter president. Although the Greek system is self-governing, professional staff advisors, chapter advisors, and live-in chapter directors/parents aid students and particular chapters with the obstacles of living in Greek chapter houses and learning. Greek dwellings that meet the necessary criteria are deemed acceptable campus housing. The Center for Student Involvement and Residential Education has copies of ""Approval of Greek Chapters as Approved University Housing,"" including the standards and ""Procedure for Greek Chapter Houses to Fulfill University Residency Policy."" For more information, visit: https://www.nebrwesleyan.edu/inside-nwu/living-campus/living-campus ",,,,,,"Nebraska Wesleyan University is one of the world's most well-known institutions for higher education.

It is a Colonial College leased before the American Revolution. Yale was relocated to New Haven, Connecticut, in 1716. It was officially renamed Yale College in 1718. In 1861, Yale became the first university in the USA to award a Doctor of Philosophy.Yale University is a part of the Ivy League of 8 American colleges and universities.
