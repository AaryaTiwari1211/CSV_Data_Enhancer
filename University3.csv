If you're a secondary education teacher candidate, you'll go from teaching one class to teaching four over the course of a semester. Clinicals Worcester State University's health-care programmes pioneered community-based, hands-on learning. The nursing, communication sciences and disorders, occupational therapy, and health sciences departments have built symbiotic relationships with healthcare providers, regional schools, and nonprofits, guided by their individual accreditation and certification exam standards.Clinics give you the opportunity to put your classroom and lab work to the test by caring for others in real-world situations and discussing new ideas, techniques, and perspectives with your partners.

The agency includes dedicated employees who assist all university students and graduates in obtaining acceptable employment following graduation. The service maintains a jobs database where you can post your criteria for free and have the proper students matched to your openings. Student engagement You can work with the University of the Highlands and Islands students in a variety of ways to meet your skill and employee needs. These are some of them: Student Work Placements or Internships A period of time in the workplace that a student spends as part of their education is usually related to their academic discipline. Work placements for students can last anywhere from two weeks to a year and can be done part-time or full-time. Unless the placement provider is a charity, a voluntary organisation, and allied fundraising group, or a statutory body, national minimum wage legislation applies.Student work placements are aided by a designated placement coordinator who will collaborate with the company to scope the placement and, if necessary, assist with the recruitment process. Throughout the placement, the coordinator will keep in touch with the student and the business and will pay visits to both to assess progress. Student Work Experience An unpaid length of time spent in the workplace by a student that is not directly related to their education or an accredited module or programme. Work Shadowing When a student observes a member of staff working in an organisation in order to obtain a better knowledge of what that employment entails, the activity is usually unpaid and offered on a short-term basis (i.e. 3–5 days). Employer-generated Student Project When an employer gives a student a brief for a specific project that requires certain knowledge or skills, this is known as a project brief. Student projects can be done singly or in groups, and they do not require the student or students to be on the premises of the company. Lecturers assist with projects, which can be paid or unpaid. Volunteering A period of unsupported time spent by a student on an activity that benefits society or the environment. Volunteering is an activity that a student engages in without receiving any compensation. Graduate Internship A period of work experience that a student undertakes after graduation, usually full-time and lasting for at least 6 months to a year.

Any exceptions to this rule will have been discussed with the university and disclosed to the placement provider before the placement begins.Each student will be assigned a mentor in the setting who will support them while they are on placement. This person should ideally be a member of staff with whom the student will likely interact daily. A University placement supervisor will pay a visit to the student and mentor in the setting (typically once during the placement) and will stay in touch and support each student. Placement Assessment: As part of the module, students will be assessed. There are three parts to the evaluation. Each component is graded solely on a pass/fail basis, and each element must be passed to pass the module. The following are the components of the evaluation:The module leader or placement supervisor and the placement host must review and agree on the placement specification created by the student.
