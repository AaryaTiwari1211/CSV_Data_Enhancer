To further strengthen its academic independence, a statute was passed in 1971, giving the college greater autonomy. In 1975, there was a major reformation, expanding the range of degree programs. The college relocated to Thomas Street in the early 1980s, allowing for further expansion of the undergraduate program and the addition of various postgraduate courses and research-based options, including doctoral level studies.","The following information pertains to the academic requirements for both undergraduate and graduate programs at NCAD for international students:

It provides a comprehensive record of your educational journey, featuring the courses you have taken and the corresponding grades obtained. This assists us in assessing your readiness for college-level studies. Our recommended guidelines are as follows*:- Four years of English courses- Three to four years of Math courses (including second-year algebra or pre-calculus)- Three years of Natural Science courses (with a minimum of two lab components)- At least two years of the same Foreign Language study 

GPA refers to Grade Point Average. 

Grading pattern refers to the grades achieved in your recent courses. 

Students whose high schools do not provide official transcripts for admission consideration may submit unofficial transcripts for review. However, to receive financial aid, official final high school transcripts must be submitted (as per federal regulations). Failure to do so may result in a registration hold on your account for the upcoming spring semester. 

WMU superscores both ACT and SAT scores, meaning we consider the highest scores achieved on each section across multiple test sittings. The testing information provided in your application will be taken into consideration during the decision-making process.

As a result, our admissions process places emphasis on various factors that we believe contribute to a student's potential for academic success. Some of these factors include grade point average (GPA), test scores, extracurricular activities, and personal statements.

For admitted seniors, the middle 50% of weighted GPA falls between 3.80 and 4.43. This means that the majority of our students have consistently achieved A or B grades, with very few or no C grades, and no D or F grades. It is important to note that the UNC System's minimum GPA requirement is 2.5, but it is highly unlikely that a GPA within this range will be considered for admission at UNCW.

It is worth mentioning that we do not recalculate GPAs submitted by applicants. However, we do evaluate them in the context of the grading scheme used by their high school. This information is readily available to your regional counselor, who plays a crucial role in your admissions process. Even if your high school does not assign a GPA, your transcript must include a version of your GPA for us to consider you for admission.
