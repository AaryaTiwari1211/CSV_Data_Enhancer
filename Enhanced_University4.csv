Here, we provide you with all the information you need to know for obtaining the necessary permits and authorizations for on-campus, off-campus, co-op/internship, and post-graduation employment.

First and foremost, a valid Study Permit is required for international students wishing to work in Canada. To obtain a Study Permit, applicants must have proof of acceptance to a designated learning institution in Canada, sufficient funds to support themselves, and be in good health. Once a Study Permit is secured, students must then obtain the appropriate permits for their desired employment.

For students enrolled in a program that requires a mandatory co-op or internship term, an Internship Work Permit must be obtained in addition to the Study Permit. This application should be submitted at the same time as the Study Permit, and at least three months before the internship begins to avoid any potential delays. This permit is free of charge and is only required if the employment is a part of the student's program, represents less than 50% of the program, and/or begins in the first term of classes.

On-campus work does not require a separate work permit, as long as the student has a valid Study Permit and is enrolled full-time. This excludes scheduled breaks and the last term before graduation. Off-campus work is limited to 20 hours per week during the academic year and full-time during specified breaks. However, if a Study Permit is granted, no separate work permit is necessary.

Upon completion of a Northern College diploma, international students may apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) to obtain an Open Work Permit. Unlike the previously mentioned permits, there are no restrictions on the type of employment and no job offer requirement for this permit. The application for the PGWP must be submitted within 90 days of receiving final grades or proof of graduation, while the Study Permit is still valid.

Finally, spouses or partners of full-time Northern College students with a valid Study Permit may also apply for an Open Work Permit. Similar to the PGWP, no job offer is necessary and the permit duration will match the student's own permit.

In summary, international students must have a valid Study Permit and adhere to the specific requirements outlined for each type of employment. Whether it be on-campus, off-campus, co-op/internship, or post-graduation, following these guidelines will ensure a smooth and successful work experience in Canada.",,"Northern College offers a thriving student life with a range of programs and opportunities to develop academically and personally.

It is a renowned collegiate institution with eleven colleges and is the oldest university in the province of Ontario. Over the years, U of T has consistently ranked among the top universities globally, with its position on the list only getting better.

According to the US News & World Report, the University of Toronto has risen to the 17th spot in their 2021 rankings, a significant improvement from its previous rankings of 20 in 2017 and 18 in 2019 and 2020. In addition to considering other factors, such as number of cited publications, global research reputation, and regional research reputation, each of these holds a weightage of 12.5% in determining the university's ranking.

QS World University Ranking has placed the university at the 25th spot for 2021, which is a notable jump from its 2020 ranking at 29. In Times Higher Education's (THE) University Ranking, U of T holds the 18th position for both 2020 and 2021, an improvement from its previous rank of 21. While THE puts equal emphasis on teaching, research, and citations, with each category holding a weightage of 30%, QS places the highest importance on academic reputation at 40%, followed by faculty-student ratio and citations per faculty, both holding a weightage of 20%.

Unlike other university rankings, the Shanghai Ranking (ARWU) does not take into account a university's reputation among academics or employers.

From international learning programs to community placements, students can explore various avenues of learning during their time at the university. These programs also provide valuable hands-on experience in different locations and working environments.

One of the unique learning opportunities at Lakehead is the option to participate in international teaching placements. This allows students to teach, learn, and work in attractive locations around the world through collaborations with international partners. The university currently offers five overseas placement destinations, including Malaysia, Sint Maarten, London, Scotland, and Wales, for a 5-week placement. It's worth noting that in the past, members of the Faculty of Education also had the chance to work in China and the United Kingdom as international teaching assistants. While these collaborations are currently inactive, they may be available in the future.

Another way for students to gain practical experience is through community placements. These placements allow students to apply their theoretical classroom knowledge in real-world situations related to history. To successfully complete a community placement, students are required to fulfill 150 community service hours, attend career seminars, and complete other relevant assignments.

Community placement, fieldwork, and internships are often used interchangeably to describe the practical work students undertake to supplement their theoretical studies. At Lakehead University, these experiences fall under the category of community placement and involve collaborating with a partner organization to gain valuable learning opportunities under the guidance of a supervisor. To be considered for a community placement, students must complete an application form provided by the Department of History. This application is also shared with the community placement partner, who selects the most suitable candidate for the placement.

In recent years, students have had the opportunity to work with a variety of community partners, including the City of Thunder Bay Archives, Lakehead University Archives, ShebaFilms, Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, Thunder Bay Military Museum, Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society, and Thunder Bay Public Library.

It effectively stands tall amongst many other research universities in Canada. Being the biggest educational establishment in Saskatchewan, Canada, it has made consistent strides in promoting higher education. The table tabulated underneath indicates the rankings garnered by the University of Saskatchewan (uSask) over the years.

The University of Saskatchewan (uSask) has been accorded a ranking of 465 by the reputed QS World University Rankings, exemplifying a climb from its earlier placement of 471 in 2016. Additionally, it was enrolled amongst the top 301-400 universities by the ARWU Shanghai Ranking for four consecutive years between 2017 and 2020. Further, the University maintained its QS World University Rankings at 465 while retaining its 538th position in the US News and World Report.

 It is pertinent to mention that different ranking systems make use of distinct criteria while assessing universities. While QS employs an extensive emphasis on Academic Reputation (40%) followed by Faculty/Student Ratio (20%) and highly cited Research Papers (20%), Times Higher Education (THE) evaluates the universities based on a parity between Teaching Quality, Research Output, and Citation (30% each). Whereas, US News & World Report relies on various parameters including the Global & Local Research Reputation as well as the Number of Published Papers (weightedized and accounts for 12.5% each) in determing the University's rankings. The Shanghai Ranking, on its part, exercises no importance accorded to an institute's standing amongst researchers and peers. Instead, it relies on scrutinizing the quality of academic research undertaken and the number of Nobel Prizes clinched by the concerned faculty.
