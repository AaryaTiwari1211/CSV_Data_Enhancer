Northwestern Polytechnic University warmly welcomes individuals with a GPA lower than the average, standing at 2.72. Applicants' high school transcripts typically reflect a mix of grades such as Bs and Cs, although it is recommended to steer clear of Ds and Fs as they may raise questions about your dedication to learning and ability to excel in college.

Requirement for Standardized Testing - SAT and ACT
Most institutions require applicants to take either the SAT or ACT, and some may also demand SAT subject tests.

Finding furnished accommodation, however, is a challenge during this period. In comparison to other cities in Germany, the rent in Heidelberg is on the higher side. Therefore, it is advisable to start looking for housing well in advance, preferably a few months before moving to Heidelberg. For visiting scholars and their families, Heidelberg University provides four guesthouses. These apartments range from one to four rooms and are equipped with all necessary amenities. The guesthouses are located on the campus, in close proximity to renowned institutions such as Max-Planck Institutes for Medical Research and International Law, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), and various university hospitals. The city center can be easily accessed through public transportation from these accommodations. Private accommodations can be found through classified ads, either in print or online. Renting through a real estate agent is the safest but most expensive option. However, there might be an additional fee of 2-3 months' rent as commission for renting through an agent.
