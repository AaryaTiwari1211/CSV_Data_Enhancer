26,4,National College of Art and Design ,national-college-of-art-and-design,"The National College of Art and Design (NCAD) originated from Robert West's drawing school, established in 1746 and funded by the Dublin Society. Its roots can be traced back to influences from the French Enlightenment, Victorian schools of design, and the Arts and Crafts movement. Over the years, the institution has played a significant role in shaping the search for Irish national identity, and has had a significant impact on the development of Irish art and design. A large number of prominent Irish artists, including Sir William Orpen and Oliver Sheppard, have received their education at NCAD.

The emergence of an independent Ireland and the country's new economic future drove the need for reform in industrial design. As a result, a statute was passed in 1971, granting NCAD academic autonomy and establishing it as an independent institution once again. In 1975, the college underwent another major reform that led to the creation of a diverse range of degree programs. In the 1980s, NCAD relocated to Thomas Street, which facilitated the expansion of its undergraduate program and the addition of various postgraduate and research-based options, including doctoral degrees.","Academic Requirements: Bachelors: Students from other countries who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree at NCAD must have a high school diploma from their respective home country that is equivalent to the Irish School Leaving Certificate.

Service-learning options are available through general education courses as well as major-specific classes. The May term also offers the chance for students to participate in short-term or semester-long service-learning activities. Completion of cross-cultural learning is a graduation requirement, and students often fulfill this requirement by embarking on foreign or domestic adventures. Our students also have the opportunity to share their cross-cultural experiences through Forum presentations and photo contests.

We understand the importance of practical experience in preparing our students for their future careers. That's why we strongly encourage students to participate in internships, research projects, and field placements. While some degree programs require these experiences, we encourage all students to consider them. We provide financial support through various grants, including Discovery Grants, Pi Delta Research Grants, Professional Enrichment Grants, and the Ministry Inquiry Program.

Our classrooms, The Commons, sports courts, and residence halls all provide opportunities for students to form lifelong connections.

On-Campus Accommodation is an important aspect of a college experience, which is why Bluffton expects traditional undergraduate students to reside in one of our residential halls if they do not live at home or within a convenient commute. Our Residential Life program oversees six residence halls and one set of apartments, with student support personnel such as hall directors, resident advisers, and ministry assistants residing in each facility.

Bren-Dell Hall, which can accommodate 95 students, is situated on the bank of Riley Creek. It is a gender-segregated residence, with separate floors for men and women. Each of the three floors has a kitchen, and the second floor has a spacious study lounge. In 2015, we renovated the hallway and main entrance to provide a more welcoming environment. Construction of Bren-Dell was completed in 1962.

Hirschy Annex, which houses up to 107 students, is also a gender-segregated residence. Similar to Bren-Dell Hall, the first floor contains a large lobby and kitchen, while the second and third floors offer rooms with a connecting hallway, a passageway, and a computer lab. Hirschy Annex was built in 1966.

Hirschy Hall, a residential hall for 97 men and women, has three floors, each with a kitchen. The main lobby on the ground floor is spacious and airy, with large windows. Hirschy Hall opened its doors in 1963, and its infamous bronze cast of Noah Hirschy, the university's first president, is believed to bring good luck to students who rub its nose before taking an exam.

Neufeld Hall, completed in 2003, is a divided hall with 108 men and women on separate wings. Seniors and juniors are given priority in residing in this hall. Each floor has a lobby, kitchen, and suite-style hallways, as well as a game room, conference room, and computer lab. The rooms are equipped with versatile furniture which can be reconfigured in 50 different ways, allowing students more freedom in arranging their living space. Each room has a bed, chest of drawers, desk and desk organizer, bookcase, and chair.

Ramseyer Hall can accommodate 109 students and also has segregated floors for men and women. Facilities such as air conditioning, an elevator, and kitchenette on every floor make living in this hall more convenient. There is also a fully equipped kitchen and a fitness facility for students to use. Ramseyer opened its doors in 1994.

Ropp Hall, the largest residence hall at Bluffton, can accommodate 231 students. A popular gathering area for students is ""The Pit,"" located near the main entrance. The majority of its nine floors have study lounges and cooking facilities, and its annex has a bigger, fully equipped kitchen. The Bluffton Centre for Academic Excellence and Health Center are also located in Ropp Hall for the convenience of students.

Ropp served as the first women's residence hall in 1914. In 1958, an additional wing called Ropp Annex was constructed, and Ropp Addition was completed in 1967. Today, Ropp Hall houses both men and women on different floors.

Originally established as a collegiate school in Saybrook, Connecticut, it was later moved to New Haven and officially renamed Yale College in 1718. In 1861, it became the first American university to award a Doctor of Philosophy degree. As a prestigious member of the Ivy League, Yale is recognized for its academic excellence worldwide, with approximately 5,200 undergraduates, 10% of whom are international students.

Comprising of fourteen schools including the Undergraduate Liberal Arts College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and multiple professional schools, Yale offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional courses in various fields.

In addition, Yale also provides opportunities for study abroad and university exchange programs, catering to deserving candidates. Notable alumni include Indra Nooyi, Hillary Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Alexei Navalny.

Yale has a strong track record in terms of placements, with students securing positions in various industries such as consulting, investment banking, private equity, venture capital, government, e-commerce, and media/entertainment. However, the most notable feature of Yale is its commitment to providing financial aid to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need without requiring any loans.

- SAT Mathematics Test, with scores between 740 and 800
- ACT Composite, with a range of 33 to 35

However, high test scores alone are not likely to compensate for a lackluster performance in secondary school. 
Non-native English speakers are required to take a proficiency test if they have not completed at least two years of secondary education in an English-speaking institution. The following are the accepted proficiency tests, with the minimum required scores:

- IELTS: a score of 7 or higher 
- PTE: a score of 70 or higher 
- DET: a minimum score of 120

The establishment of Victory Institute furthered their vision of grooming and supporting LGBTQ leaders running for office. Along with coaching future candidates and campaign personnel, the organization launched the Presidential Appointments Project, which paved the way for Roberta Achtenberg's historic appointment as the first openly LGBTQ individual in a Senate-confirmed position as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

employment assistance programs for students. Our goal is to help students gain valuable experience in their desired fields and prepare them for successful careers.

Internships:
We strongly believe in providing hands-on learning opportunities for our students. That's why we offer a variety of internships to support their academic growth. It is mandatory for students registered for a for-credit internship to submit a completed Student Placement Agreement to the Career Center by the fifth day of the semester. Failure to do so may result in an administrative dismissal from the internship course. To ensure a smooth process, we have provided students with detailed guides, including the Internship Handbook and Summer Internship Guidance. Employers looking to host an intern can also benefit from our resources, such as the Host Site Agreement and the Host Site Agreement Workflow. We also have a Student Placement Agreement and step-by-step instructions for completing it. In case of any incidents during an internship, students can report them using our Internship Incident Form. International students can refer to our CPT Frequently Asked Questions guide for more information about internships.

Hosting an Intern:
We encourage organizations to offer internships to our students as a way to contribute to their learning and development. Providing a valuable internship experience can also be beneficial for businesses. Interested employers can refer to our Host Site Agreement to formalize the terms of the internship, and they can use our Host Site Agreement Workflow for a smooth process. We also participate in Indiana INTERNnet, a platform that offers micro-internships, which are short-term, project-based experiences to students. Employers who have internship opportunities can also post them on this platform. To gain more insights, employers can refer to our Indiana INTERNnet Internship How-To Guide.

Finding Internships:
We have multiple resources for students to help them find internships that fit their interests and career goals. Our partnership with Handshake allows students to book appointments with Career Coaches for internship assistance. Students can also explore internships on popular websites like IndianaINTERNnet, Internships.com, LinkedIn, and Parker Dewey. Our university also offers Internship Scholarship Programs with specific criteria to provide targeted experiences to students. We have also introduced a new resource, ""Request an Experience"" on Handshake, which allows students to apply for experiences, with or without credit, to expand their skills and network.

Employment:

These include Amazon, Apple, Barclays, Disney, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Rolls Royce, Chicago Cubs, FedEx, Hershey, NCAA, Toyota, Southwest Airlines, Infosys, Chicago Police, Seattle Mariners, Nestle, and many more.

International students with a TOEFL Writing sub-score of 23, TOEFL Essentials Writing sub-score of 7.0, or IELTS Writing sub-score of 6.0 are eligible for English Composition I (EH 101). Students with lower scores will be assigned English Composition for Second Language Writers (EH 108).

Similarly, students without math credit or above remedial level must take the ALEKS Math Placement Assessment (MPA) to register for a math course. If for any reason a student cannot take the MPA, they can enroll in MA 094 (Basic Mathematics) or MA 098 (Applied Mathematics).

Such internships are available at companies where students hope to work. Notification for fall and spring internships will be received in August and December, respectively.
