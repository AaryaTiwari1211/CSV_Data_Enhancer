The position of UMBC has steadily slipped in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking), from 301-400 in 2016 to 601-700 in 2021.

UMBC has received a more than 200 point drop from QS. It shows that UMBC has underperformed in key areas like scholarly reputation, faculty to student ratio, and faculty citations per article.
