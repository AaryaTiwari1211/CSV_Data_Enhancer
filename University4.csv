Host families give homestay students security, care, and safety, which also help them feel a part of the family and learn about Canadian culture. In British Columbia, students under 19 must live with a host family and have a local legal guardian. If they so choose, students over 19 may also choose to reside with a host family. If necessary, homestay firms offer guardianship services to international students. Apartment Rental SingleFrom one neighbourhood to the next, renting an apartment in Vancouver may be expensive. Downtown, Yaletown, Cambie Village, and West Vancouver are some of Vancouver's priciest neighbourhoods. The monthly rent for a studio or one-bedroom apartment in certain places may exceed $2,000. Apartments may start at $1000 a month in less expensive parts of the city such as East Vancouver, Commercial Drive, Fraserview, and Marpole.
